<p>I've always wanted to be a writer. Too bad I can't go viral and become a big hit. I really liked making websites when I was a teenager and I'd really like to learn to code. This little intro to coding is mostly review since I remember basic HTML from high school. I didn't mess with CSS <b>often</b> or I would find pre-built CSS codes for me to input on websites like myspace and VF. </p>
